## Description
During the second edition of the Radio-Canada Hackathon, our team developed a neural network whose function is to
differentiate fake news articles from legitimate news articles. The very limited access to French databases on
fake news platforms forced us to manually parse domains of different news platforms, and due to the nature of the
Hackathon, we didn't have time to collect enough data to train our model well enough, as it was overfitting.
